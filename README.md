The aim of this project is to predict the yearly revenue generated by customers based on various features such as length of membership, time spent on the app, time spent on the website, etc. Understanding the factors influencing customer spending can help businesses tailor their strategies to enhance customer engagement and maximize revenue. In this project, we explore various regression techniques to develop a predictive model for customer revenue.

Descriptive Analysis of the Dataset
How much data is present?
The dataset comprises 500 data points with 8 attributes.

What attributes/features are continuous valued?
Continuous valued attributes include:

Avg. Session Length
Time on App
Time on Website
Length of Membership
Yearly Amount Spent
Which attributes are categorical?
Categorical attributes include:

Email
Address
Avatar
Checking for Null/Nan values
Before proceeding with the analysis, it is crucial to ensure that the dataset does not contain any missing values, as they can adversely affect the performance of machine learning models. Fortunately, there are no NaN values in the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is essential to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among variables. This step involves visualizing data and calculating summary statistics to understand the underlying patterns.

Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning algorithms, it is necessary to preprocess the data. This involves scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Regression Techniques
SVD Linear Regression: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique used to decompose a matrix into singular vectors and singular values. SVD Linear Regression utilizes this decomposition for regression analysis.

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that penalizes large coefficients to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function.

Lasso Regression: Lasso regression, similar to ridge regression, introduces a penalty term to the OLS objective function. However, lasso regression employs L1 regularization, which tends to produce sparse models by setting some coefficients to zero.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD is an optimization algorithm used for training machine learning models. It iteratively updates the model parameters to minimize the loss function. SGD is particularly useful for large datasets and is applicable to various regression algorithms.

Multiple Regression: Multiple regression involves predicting a continuous target variable using multiple predictor variables. It is a fundamental technique in regression analysis and serves as a baseline model for comparison.

Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of regression models, we employ appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²) coefficient.

Conclusion
In this project, we explored various regression techniques to predict yearly revenue generated by customers. By analyzing the dataset, preprocessing the data, and applying regression algorithms, we developed predictive models capable of estimating customer spending based on relevant features. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the accuracy and generalization capability of the models, aiding businesses in making informed decisions to enhance customer engagement and maximize revenue.
